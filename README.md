# pacman-fruit-through-search-alg

### Goal
This project is designed to simulate a specific scenario in which the video game character Pac-Man has just eaten a large dot and is temporarily invulnerable to ghosts. The objective is to use search algorithms to determine the shortest path for Pac-Man to reach and collect the fruit.

### Justification
The purpose of this problem for the students is to illustrate the practical application of search algorithms. Additionally, it helps develop an understanding of how to select the most suitable algorithm for a given problem.
